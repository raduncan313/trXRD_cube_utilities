# trXRD_cube_utilities
Some elementary MATLAB uilities to help with analysis of ultrafast x-ray diffraction experiments

See `example.m` for a script that does some standard ROI-based processing of cubed data.

See `mapping_example.m` for a script that runs an hkl-mapping of an angle scan.

Both of these example scripts require some data that I won't post to GitHub, so ask me for it if you would like to run them.
